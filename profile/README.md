CutCorner is a barbershop app designed to improve the haircut experience for both customers and barbers. Our app tackles common problems such as choosing the right barbershop, understanding customer preferences, and overcoming long waiting times. By collaborating with barbershop partners in Surabaya, CutCorner aims to provide a seamless and enjoyable experience for users.

To address these challenges, CutCorner offers various features, including online booking, AI-assisted hairstyle selection, and customised pricing. Our app not only increases convenience for customers but also helps barbershops manage their services more efficiently. Through our platform, we hope to increase customer satisfaction and support the growth of our barbershop partners in Surabaya.

For now, the features we have in mind in the app we will be creating include:
- User Registration and Authentication:
<br /> Users can create an account and log in to access the app's features and make transactions using a google account, facebook account or entering an email and password.

- Search and Filters:
<br /> Users can search for barbershops and services based on certain keywords, categories or criteria to find relevant options.

- Barbershop Profiles:
<br /> Barbershops have customised profiles to showcase their services, ratings, reviews and other relevant information.

- Order Management:
<br /> Users can view and manage their appointments, including order history, tracking, and status updates.

- AI-Assisted Hairstyle Selection:
<br /> The app uses AI to help users select a suitable hairstyle based on their preferences and features.

- Online Booking:
<br /> Users can view the current queue and book directly through the app running in real-time, reducing waiting time and ensuring a smoother experience

- Customised Pricing:
<br /> Barbershops can set customised prices for their services, providing transparency and flexibility for customers.

These features are still in the works and may be reduced or increased at the end, depending on the needs and feedback from users and barbershop partners.
